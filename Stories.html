<h1>Timbles V.S. Fairies</h1>
<p>Once, even before Dreamland was real, Timbles and Fairies were enemies. There were two towns. one was Timble Town and one was Fairy Fantastick. Once a fairy named Tulip crossed the line separating the towns. The Timbles were furious. A war began. The Fairies fought for peace while the Timbles fought for separation. Then I came along. I found the bad place. I stopped the war and became queen. </p>
    <h2>Thunder</h2>
<p>Once,a thunder storm struck. Everybody hid. I had no place to hide. Thunder rumbled and lightning struck. Rain hit and pattered at the ground so hard that it hurt my skin. A fairy named Grace was with me and I was under a Timble named Jane. The rain hurt us all. Just at that moment, a bolt of lightning struck Jane, Jane fell on Grace and shocked me. Both Jane and Grace were rushed to the hospital. Grace had sadly died and Jane was badly injured. I was fine.  </p>
