 <p>The loco cream pie has a storie that goes with it. The story starts with a 13 year-old girl named Clara Lira Birlingrodder. One day, Clara was on a hike with 2 friends named Elle Diego Bolard and Larisa a.k.a Lari Tami Nickerson when they got lost. Thankfully, Elle, Lari and Clara had all brought food, water and sleeping bags. Lari also had brought a tent. They camped for the night and the next day they found a cherry tree. The cherry tree told them that their homes were East and gave them each a magic cherry. They got home and baked the cherries. The cherry then turned into pie, for they were all poor and these pies gave them food. The end.</p>
